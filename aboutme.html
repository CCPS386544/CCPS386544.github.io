    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I'm working towards a scholarship for sports, which will need me to be intelligent with good grades and athletic. So I'm working to be a good Student-Athlete. I working toward my goals by bringing my grade up and working hard in sports. I believe that Growth is the most important value for success cause u cant be your best self while not growing mentally and physically. I want to get higher maxes in workouts and be a 3.0 student ending off the year and during summer ill work hard everyday so when season comes back I'm ready for the worst, I want to start off next year a lot better then how I started this year. I want to be known as a passionate humble leader who works hard and stays focused on the task at hand. I want people to know me as a good Student-Athlete cause with out the student you wont go to far because you need certain grades to play sports and some schools wont look at you because of bad grades, which will lessen your chance of getting scouted and getting a offer for a scholarship. </p>
